# Patch34: Focus Blanket

Auditory Focus Screen is a one-click REAPER Lua toggle that adds a single full-screen “focus blanket” track to reduce visual noise while you listen.

## Overview

Focus Blanket is built for moments when you want to *listen more than look*. It temporarily replaces the busy arrange view with a calm, minimal visual layer: one tall track at the top and one long neutral-colored item spanning the project length.

When you toggle it off, it removes the focus track and restores your previous selection and arrange-view time range.

**Key ideas:**
- Reduce visual noise during playback
- One-track full-screen visual “blanket”
- Clean toggle workflow with restore
